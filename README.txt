ObjectPrinter dumps the object graph for a given object, 
similar to print in php & python or console.log in nodejs.

Why ObjectPrinter vs. json
- system types can be output to string to reduce noise
- use custom type inspectors to prevent inspection
  of lazy load properties.

*******************************************

I've found this to be most beneficial in two main areas:

1) Inspecting objects from 3rd party libraries.  
Every once in a great while, the documentation of a 3rd party 
library may be found wanting. Dumping an object with data can 
bring clarity to the implementation.
 
2) Capturing context for an exception.  
In a typical logging scenario, when capturing context of an 
exception, you catch the exception, log data and then throw 
the exception again.  

With the ex.SetContext(name, object) extension method, the 
relevant data can be added to the ex.Data element to be 
printed with the exception when it's logged.  Logging thelog  
data context with the exception reduces the need to track
down related log messages.

The ex.Data member requires all objects being added to be 
serializable. It's easy for a property to be added within the 
graph of a logged object that is not serializable.  To handle
this ex.SetContext will wrap the object in a class that will 
print the object when the exception is serialized.

*******************************************

Type Inspectors (the tweakability of the ObjectPrinter): 
ObjectPrinter enumerates a list of inspectors to determine 
which inspector should be used for a given type.  The chosen 
inspector then returns a list of members for the ObjectPrinter
to print.

An example is the ExceptionTypeInspector which makes sure the 
base exception properties are always printed in the same order, 
followed by inherited fields and properties, then the stack trace, 
and finally the Data dictionary. This gives a consistent view
of exceptions so you'll always know where to look.

The type inspectors can be overridden by setting the ObjectPrinterConfig.GetInspectors delegate
or changing the static ObjectPrinterConfig.DefaultTypeInspectors property. 

The default implementation is:

    public static Func<IEnumerable<ITypeInspector>> GetInspectors = ObjectPrinterConfig.DefaultTypeInspectors;
	public static IEnumerable<ITypeInspector> DefaultTypeInspectors = new TypeInspectorsRegistration().GetRegisteredInspectors();

A type inspector can define a specific type inspector to use for any members it returns.

calling TypeInspectorsRegistration().GetRegisteredInspectors() without registering
inspectors or overriding existing inspectors will return these inspectors in this order:

		new EnumTypeInspector(),
		new ExceptionTypeInspector(),
		new XmlNodeTypeInspector(), 
		new DictionaryTypeInspector(), 
		new NameValueCollectionTypeInspector(), 
		new EnumerableTypeInspector(), 
		new ToStringTypeInspector { ShouldInspectType = Funcs.IncludeMsBuiltInNamespaces },
		new InspectAllTypeInspector(), //from ObjectPrinterConfig.CatchAllTypeInspector

Another example of a custom type inspector would be for your ORM 
entities.  The inspector could be smart enough to prevent the entity
from lazy loading a property and printing out your entire database.

*******************************************

Log4Net:
add the following as the first element in the log4net config section to use the ObjectPrinter 
for all objects passed to the logger

	<renderer renderingClass="ObjectPrinter.Log4Net.Log4NetObjectRenderer, ObjectPrinter.Log4Net" renderedClass="System.Object" />
or
	<renderer renderingClass="ObjectPrinter.Log4Net.Log4NetObjectRenderer, ObjectPrinter.Log4Net" renderedClass="System.Exception" />

It may not work if it's not the first line in the config.

When using the log4net appender, you'll need to add Log4NetTypeInspector as ObjectPrinterConfig.GetInspectors to
			() => new List<ITypeInspector>
			      	{
		                new EnumTypeInspector(),
                        new XmlNodeTypeInspector(), 
                        new DictionaryTypeInspector(), 
                        new NameValueCollectionTypeInspector(), 
                        new EnumerableTypeInspector(), 
		                new ExceptionTypeInspector(),
		                new Log4NetTypeInspector(),
			      		new ToStringTypeInspector { ShouldInspectType = Funcs.IncludeMsBuiltInNamespaces },
			      		new InspectAllTypeInspector(),
			      	}


*******************************************

Performance:
* ObjectPrinter is intended to be used in exceptional cases where the time 
  spent rendering the object will save significant time in debugging.
* Interogating objects requires reflection, which is expensive.
  Caching can be disabled via InspecAlltypeInspector.DefaultEnableCaching.
  Caching could hurt performance if a large number of types are cached.
  Determine what's best for your application.
* If used on lazy-load objects, you could end up with a huge object 
  graph, which is probably not what you want.
* When logging to log4net, use the object renderer to prevent the 
  ObjectPrinter from being used until it needs to be.  
* For logging frameworks that don't support custom renderers 
  (including Common.Logging), ensure the logging level is enabled 
  before calling Dump()
